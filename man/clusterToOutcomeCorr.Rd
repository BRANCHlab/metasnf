\title{Functions to calculate correlation between cluster assignment to outcome variables and visualize to find meaningful clusters with Manhattan plot}
\usage{
clusterToOutcomeCorr(df, outcomes, method, datatype, size)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{a dataframe of samples with cluster_column and outcomes columns.}

\item{outcomes}{one or more outcomes of interest from df}

\item{method}{correlation test method ("chi-squared" or "kruskal")}

\item{datatype}{name of the SNF integration datatype}

\item{size}{sample size of the datatype integrated}
}
\value{
out a dataframe of correlation test results of each cluster categories vs outcomes. output can be fed directly into clusterToOutcomeManhattan
}
\description{
Calculate correlation of clusters to each outcome using chi-squared (categorical outcome) and/or kruskal-wallis test (continuous outcome) in each data set that were integrated using SNF, and then generates long format data input for ClustersToOutcomeManhattan
}
