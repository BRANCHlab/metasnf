This vignette walks through usage of `similarity_matrix_heatmap` to visualize the final similarity matrix produced by a run of SNF and how that matrix associates with other patient attributes.

## Data set-up

```{r}
library(metasnf)

# Generate data_list
data_list <- generate_data_list(
    list(
        data = expression_df,
        name = "expression_data",
        domain = "gene_expression",
        type = "continuous"
    ),
    list(
        data = methylation_df,
        name = "methylation_data",
        domain = "gene_methylation",
        type = "continuous"
    ),
    list(
        data = gender_df,
        name = "gender",
        domain = "demographics",
        type = "categorical"
    ),
    list(
        data = diagnosis_df,
        name = "diagnosis",
        domain = "clinical",
        type = "categorical"
    ),
    list(
        data = age_df,
        name = "age",
        domain = "demographics",
        type = "discrete"
    ),
    uid = "patient_id"
)

# Generate settings_matrix
set.seed(42)
settings_matrix <- generate_settings_matrix(
    data_list,
    nrow = 1,
    max_k = 40
)

# Run SNF and clustering
batch_snf_results <- batch_snf(
    data_list,
    settings_matrix,
    return_similarity_matrices = TRUE
)

solutions_matrix <- batch_snf_results$"solutions_matrix"
similarity_matrices <- batch_snf_results$"similarity_matrices"

# The first (and only) similarity matrix:
similarity_matrix <- similarity_matrices[[1]]

# The first (and only) cluster solution:
cluster_solution <- get_cluster_solutions(solutions_matrix)$"1"
```

## Visualize similarity matrices sorted by cluster label

`similarity_matrix_heatmap` is a wrapper for `ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap`, but with some convenient default transformations and parameters for viewing a similarity matrix.

```{r eval = FALSE}
similarity_matrix_hm <- similarity_matrix_heatmap(
    similarity_matrix = similarity_matrix,
    cluster_solution = cluster_solution,
    heatmap_height = grid::unit(10, "cm"),
    heatmap_width = grid::unit(10, "cm")
)

# Export heatmaps using the `save_heatmap` function
save_heatmap(
    heatmap = similarity_matrix_hm,
    path = "./similarity_matrix_heatmap.png",
    width = 410,
    height = 330,
    res = 80
)
```

The default transformations include plotting log(Similarity) rather than the default similarity matrix as well as rescaling the diagonal of the matrix to the average value of the off-diagonals.
Additionally, the similarity matrix gets reordered according to the provided cluster solution.

## Annotations

One piece of functionality provided by `ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap` is the ability to supply visual annotations along the rows and columns of a heatmap.

You can always build annotations using the standard approaches outline in the [ComplexHeatmap Complete Reference](https://jokergoo.github.io/ComplexHeatmap-reference/book/index.html).
In addition to that, this package offers some convenient functionality to specify regular heatmap annotations and barplot annotations directly through a provided dataframe or data_list (or both).

In the example below, we make use of data supplied through a data_list.

```{r eval = FALSE}

annotated_sm_hm <- similarity_matrix_heatmap(
    similarity_matrix = similarity_matrix,
    cluster_solution = cluster_solution,
    scale_diag = "mean",
    log_graph = TRUE,
    data_list = data_list,
    left_hm = list(
        "Diagnosis" = "diagnosis"
    ),
    top_hm = list(
        "Gender" = "gender"
    ),
    top_bar = list(
        "Age" = "age"
    ),
    annotation_colours = list(
        Diagnosis = c(
            "definite asthma" = "red3",
            "possible asthma" = "pink1",
            "no asthma" = "bisque1"
        ),
        Gender = c(
            "female" = "purple",
            "male" = "lightgreen"
        )
    ),
    heatmap_height = grid::unit(10, "cm"),
    heatmap_width = grid::unit(10, "cm")
)

save_heatmap(
    heatmap = annotated_sm_hm,
    path = "./annotated_sm_heatmap.png",
    width = 500,
    height = 440,
    res = 80
)
```

</center>

The colours `red3`, `pink1`, etc. are built-in R colours that you can browse by calling `colours()`.

For reference, the code below shows how you would achieve these annotations using standard `ComplexHeatmap` syntax.

```{r eval = FALSE}
merged_df <- collapse_dl(data_list)
order <- sort(cluster_solution, index.return = TRUE)$"ix"
merged_df <- merged_df[order, ]

top_annotations <- ComplexHeatmap::HeatmapAnnotation(
    Age = ComplexHeatmap::anno_barplot(merged_df$"age"),
    Gender = merged_df$"gender",
    col = list(
        Gender = c(
            "female" = "purple",
            "male" = "lightgreen"
        )
    ),
    show_legend = TRUE
)

left_annotations <- ComplexHeatmap::rowAnnotation(
    Diagnosis = merged_df$"diagnosis",
    col = list(
        Diagnosis = c(
            "definite asthma" = "red3",
            "possible asthma" = "pink1",
            "no asthma" = "bisque1"
        )
    ),
    show_legend = TRUE
)

similarity_matrix_heatmap(
    similarity_matrix = similarity_matrix,
    cluster_solution = cluster_solution,
    scale_diag = "mean",
    log_graph = TRUE,
    data = merged_df,
    top_annotation = top_annotations,
    left_annotation = left_annotations
)

```

## More on sorting

Be aware that the ordering of both your data and your similarity matrix will be influenced if you supply values for the `cluster_solution` or `order` parameters.
If you don't think your data is lining up properly, consider manually making sure your `similarity_matrix` rows and columns are sorted to your preference (e.g., based on cluster) and that the order of your data matches.
This will be easier to do with a `dataframe` than with a `data_list`, as the `data_list` forces patients to be sorted by their unique IDs upon generation.
