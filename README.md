## Installation

**This package is currently under active development.**

We recommend installing the latest development version of the package
(it has the best stuff!):

``` r
devtools::install_github("BRANCHlab/metasnf")
```

If you require a stable version of the package, please keep track of
which commit you want when installing.

``` r
devtools::install_github("BRANCHlab/metasnf@8badfd4d7acaaf3b3c7af62d52b5c9324b82cc6c")
```

## Overview

*metasnf* is a package that facilitates usage of the meta clustering
paradigm described in ([Caruana et al. 2006](#ref-caruanaMeta2006)) with
the similarity network fusion (SNF) data integration procedure developed
in ([Wang et al. 2014](#ref-wangSimilarity2014)).

This package enables repeated iterations of SNF with distinct clustering
hyperparameters and combinations of input variables by making use of a
few key data structures.

The major structures are:

### The `design_matrix`

The `design_matrix` is a dataframe that includes all tunable clustering
settings as columns. Each row represents a distinct set of clustering
settings that will be used to produce a single clustering solution by
SNF and spectral clustering.

### The `data_list`

The `data_list` is a nested list that contains all preprocessed input
data that is ready to be used for clustering. Each list within a
`data_list` contains (1) a dataframe that will be used for clustering,
(2) the name of that dataframe, (3) the **domain** of that dataframe,
and (4) the type of data (continuous, ordinal, discrete, nominal
(categorical), or mixed) of the features within that dataframe.

Domains are user-specified labels that indicate which dataframes
describe similar sources of data. For example, structural MRI data and
diffusion MRI data may be grouped within a neuroimaging domain.

### The `outcome_list`

An optional data structure that closely resembles the `data_list`, but
contains data sources which are not meant to be included as direct
inputs for clustering. Data within the `outcome_list` is reserved for
out-of-model measures for comparing completed clustering solutions.

### The `output_matrix`

The `output_matrix` is a large dataframe that appends cluster solution
columns (one column per subject) to the `design_matrix`. It contains all
the clustering results generated by the different settings included in
the `design_matrix`.

An `output_matrix` can be convereted to an `extended_output_matrix`
which contains overall regression p-values for any measures stored in an
`outcome_list`. The `extended_output_matrix` is useful in pipelines
where separation across one or several variables stored in the
`outcome_list` serve as the primary metric for automating the selection
of a top clustering solution.

Alternatively, a top clustering solution can be selected from a regular
`output_matrix` using the traditional meta clustering approach of
clustering cluster solutions and manually examining a few solutions from
the qualitatively distinct “meta clusters” that emerge.

## Work in progress:

1.  Change in package name
2.  Changes in function names
3.  Capability of defining custom distance metrics
4.  Capability of defining custom feature weights
5.  Capability of defining custom SNF-level weights
6.  Capability of defining custom clustering algorithms
7.  Added flexibility during generation of the settings_matrix
    (currently known as the design_matrix)
8.  New visualization functions and improvements to existing
    visualization functions
9.  Capability of calculating solution stability across patient
    resamplings for all cluster solutions
10. Capability of calculating a wide range of quality metrics for all
    cluster solutions
11. Capability of writing affinity matrices to disk
12. Capability of not running the clustering on every run of SNF (only
    makes sense when paired with the previous change)
13. Updated vignette(s) to fully document basic and advance usage of the
    package
14. Maybe some other things!
